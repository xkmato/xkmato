Welcome to xkmato — a space where I think out loud, explore the nature of our reality, share hard-earned knowledge, take creative swings within my reach, and build the world I want to live in.

I believe storytelling is to humans what programming languages like Python are to computers: a powerful interface that can shape perception, inspire action, and unlock potential. While stories may not alter our biology, they can rewire how we see ourselves and the world — much like how the right software can transform what a machine is capable of, even with the same hardware.

Here, I try to write the kinds of stories I wish someone had written for me — before I had to write them myself.
